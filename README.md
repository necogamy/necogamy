- In my career in programming, interacting with other programmers, and in so much self-learning too, I have acquired essentials **Soft Skills** too.
- **And the most important that I have acquired It's:** *Self-Learning(Self-taught learning)*, *Researching(Useful skill)*, *Problem-Solving(Too important)*, *Teamwork(working with other programmers)*, *a bit of leadership(I was leader in some projects)*.
- And while working with teams I learned that the *Positivity*, *Empathy*, *Responsibility* are the most important **soft skills** for a team members or leaders that I acquired.
                                              
                                              
         - I'm not only doing Web Projects (like Full stack, Single Page Applications, Web Sites, Web Applications, front-end or back-end), I'm doing other projects like node scripts or examples of test driven development that I'm uploading to my repositories.
